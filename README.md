# ECS289M Project - Inferring Keystrokes on Touch Screen Smartphones from Gyroscope Motion
Team member: Dhruvatara Bhogishetty

Project Plan:

Phase 1 - Data collection [4/16 - 4/21]
Collect gyroscope measurements for the training, testing and validation datasets from the smartphone.

Phase 2 - Feature extraction [4/21 - 5/5]
Extract the basic and advanced features outlined in [1].

Phase 3 - Training the classifier [5/5 - 5/15]
Build a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier to predict the key (0-9) entered.

Phase 4 - Evaluation [5/15 - 5/25]
Evaluate the classifier on the validation data and compare this result with the results in [1].
